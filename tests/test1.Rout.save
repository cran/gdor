Call:
 glm(formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), family = binomial, x = TRUE, data = "data.cond") 

 MLE failed to exist, solution is 'at infinity'. A limiting conditional model
 had to be implemented to obtain relevant output. MLE exists 'at infinity'
 in direction: 
[1] 53.3636 -6.5455  0.1818

 In addition, limiting conditional model is completely degenerate.
